- Comprehensive guide covering every Blueprint node
- Step-by-step examples and patterns
- Best practices and troubleshooting
- Common use cases and workflows

### Quick Start (Blueprint)
1. Enable the AsyncHelper plugin
2. In Blueprint, search for "Async Helper" nodes
3. Use "Async Delay" for basic delayed execution
4. Use "Async Task Chain" for sequential operations
5. Use "Async Delay With Timeout" for operations that might hang

## üéØ Common Use Cases

### Game Development
- **Loading Screens**: Async loading with progress tracking
- **Animations**: Sequential animation chains with delays
- **UI Transitions**: Smooth, non-blocking interface changes
- **Gameplay Timers**: Cooldowns, delays, and timed events
- **Cutscenes**: Scripted sequences with precise timing

### System Operations
- **File I/O**: Non-blocking file operations with timeout
- **Network Requests**: Async networking with timeout handling
- **Asset Loading**: Parallel asset loading with progress
- **Database Operations**: Async queries with timeout protection
- **User Input**: Timed input windows with fallbacks

## üîß Installation

1. Copy the AsyncHelper folder to your project's `Plugins` directory
2. Add the plugin to your `.uproject` file:
   ```json
   {
     "Name": "AsyncHelper",
     "Enabled": true
   }
   ```
3. Regenerate project files
4. Compile your project
5. Enable the plugin in the Plugin Browser

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Access settings through: **Edit ‚Üí Project Settings ‚Üí Plugins ‚Üí Async Helper**

### Key Settings
- **Max Concurrent Tasks**: Control memory usage and performance
- **Cleanup Interval**: Balance between memory usage and CPU overhead
- **Task Info Retention Time**: How long to keep completed task information
- **Enable Performance Stats**: Track usage for optimization
- **Enable Detailed Logging**: Verbose debug output for development

## üéÆ Blueprint Nodes Reference

### Basic Operations
- `Async Delay`: Simple delayed execution
- `Cancel Async Task`: Cancel specific task
- `Cancel All Async Tasks`: Cancel all running tasks
- `Is Async Task Running`: Check task status

### Advanced Operations
- `Async Task Chain`: Sequential task execution
- `Async Delay With Timeout`: Timeout-protected operations
- `Execute Async Batch`: Parallel task execution

### Monitoring
- `Get Async Task Info`: Detailed task information
- `Get Running Task Count`: Active task monitoring
- `Get Performance Stats`: Usage statistics
- `Is Async Helper Available`: System availability check

## üí° Example Workflows

### Loading Screen with Progress
```
1. Execute Async Batch (for parallel loading)
2. Connect OnTaskExecuted to update progress bar
3. Connect OnCompleted to hide loading screen
4. Connect OnTimedOut for error handling
```

### Sequential Animation Chain
```
1. Async Task Chain with indices [0,1,2,3]
2. OnTaskExecuted ‚Üí Switch on Int ‚Üí Trigger specific animation
3. Set delay between tasks for smooth transitions
4. OnCompleted ‚Üí Final state
```

### Timed User Input
```
1. Async Delay With Timeout (input window)
2. OnCompleted ‚Üí User provided input in time
3. OnTimedOut ‚Üí Proceed with default action
4. OnCancelled ‚Üí Handle interruption
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Components
- **UAsyncHelperSubsystem**: Game Instance Subsystem managing all operations
- **UAsyncTaskManager**: Core task execution and management
- **UAsyncDelayAction**: Blueprint async action for delays
- **UAsyncTaskChainAction**: Blueprint async action for task chains
- **UAsyncTimeoutAction**: Blueprint async action for timeout operations
- **UAsyncHelperBlueprintLibrary**: Static function library for easy access
- **UAsyncHelperSettings**: Configurable plugin settings

### Task Types
- **Simple Delay**: Basic timed execution
- **Delay with Result**: Execution with success/failure feedback
- **Task Chain**: Sequential execution with progress tracking
- **Timeout Operations**: Time-limited execution with fallback
- **Batch Operations**: Parallel execution with completion tracking

## üîç Performance Considerations

### Optimization Tips
- Use meaningful task names for debugging
- Cancel unnecessary tasks to free resources
- Monitor performance stats during development
- Configure cleanup intervals based on usage patterns
- Use batch operations for multiple parallel tasks

### Memory Management
- Automatic cleanup of completed tasks
- Configurable retention time for task information
- Efficient shared pointer usage for task data
- Thread-safe operations with minimal overhead

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Tasks not executing**: Check AsyncHelper subsystem availability
- **Performance issues**: Reduce concurrent task count or adjust cleanup interval
- **Memory usage**: Lower task retention time or increase cleanup frequency
- **Blueprint errors**: Ensure proper event connections and valid parameters

### Debug Tools
- Enable detailed logging in plugin settings
- Use "Get Performance Stats" for usage monitoring
- Check "Get Running Task Count" for active operations
- Use meaningful task names for easier identification

## üìã Requirements

- **Platforms**: All platforms supported by UE5
- **Dependencies**: Core, CoreUObject, Engine
- **Build Tools**: Visual Studio 2022 (Windows)
